# ES-Themes-RG-350
Hello everybody! 

Welcome to my EmulationStation themes for RG-350 repository!!! 
In this repo you'll find the themes I've made for RG-350. Some of them are just reworks of pre-existent themes, adapting to EmulationStation's RG-350 version. 

At the moment, you could get all my themes (CG16/NEOGEO/PCE/PSX/SNES/TG16) at once by downloading "themes.zip" package above.

CG16/PCE/TG16 themes are based on 'Spare' theme by Matt Kennedy, with some modifications on icon positioning and custom made backgrounds.

CG16 background is based on the original CoreGrafx16 Mini user interface, but simplified.

TG16 background is based on the original TurboGrafx16 Mini user interface, but simplified.

PCE background is based on the original PC Engine Mini user interface, but simplified.

SNES background is based on Ruckage's Theme.
