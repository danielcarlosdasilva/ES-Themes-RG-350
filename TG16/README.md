# TG16
Theme for Emulationstation


##About

This theme was based on 'spare' v1.0 - 2016-08-18, made by (c) Matt Kennedy. All the original code are from this theme, but I changed the background to resemble the "Turbografx16 Mini" user interface.

##Artwork

- All Logo graphics are from the default Carbom theme made by Eric Hettervik.

##Notes

- This theme was made for RG-350 and similar systems, with only "Simple View" in mind. So, expect bugs if you try it with other combinations.
